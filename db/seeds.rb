Living in social groups makes it easier to hunt for food and, in a dangerous environment, it makes sense in terms of safety to move about in large numbers.",
                   "Clichés are worn out, overused and over-familiar phrases, and the etymology of the word helps to explain this. Originally, a clichés or stereotype was a printer’s term for a pre-set block of type with phrases used frequently in the newspapers. The word has since adopted a negative meaning and careful writers avoid them where they can.",
                   "Over time a split would have appeared in wolf populations, he says those wolves that feared humans, and those that didn’t. So this would have facilitated, I think, the domestication process. At which point humans deliberately took wolves as pets. But that domestication process, Frantz says, may have happened more than once first in the west, in Europe. And again in the Far East, in Asia.",
                   "Collins and Greg Stock, Yosemite’s park geologists, wanted to know if small rock movements, induced by changing temperatures, might weaken cracks and contribute to rock falls. So the researchers-who were both climbers-found a suitable fracture near the base of a 500-meter-tall cliff and installed instruments called crack meters, which monitored the width of the crack over time.",

                   "At random times throughout the day, the program asked some 2,200 participants what they were doing, what they were thinking about and how they felt. Turns out that people spend nearly half their waking hours thinking about something other than what they’re doing. And that whether and where their thoughts tend to stray is a better predictor of their feelings than what they’re actually up to.",
                   "Pudritzl and Heller suggest that hunters of extraterrestrial life may want to listen particularly closely for signals originating at star systems within that narrow band of galactic sky. Advanced civilizations there may have already detected us using the transit method, they say, and may now be sending us a message. You might think of this paper, then, like a treasure map, for intelligent life.",
                   "To examine what we really think about creativity, scientists asked students to present ideas for how airlines can get more revenue from their passengers. Half the students were told to come up with novel solutions, and the rest were asked to stick with something more tried-and-true. Other students who then listened to these pitches rated those who were innovative as having less leadership potential.",

Later he realized there was more to it than that and there were several ways of interpreting the Revolution as a struggle between the king and parliament, as a class war or as an unpredictable situation without clear sides.",

The cold will begin soon, if it hasn’t already, and last until at least the end of the year. Some regions will freeze, it will snow, and climate deniers will gloat. The cause is a phenomenon that, while mysterious, is known to science. We call it ‘winter.’",

                   "Psychologists have spent years analysing human interactions to try to work out what it is that makes someone nod. The results have been poor. Studying interactions is gruelling and time-consuming work. The rule of thumb in the field is that each recorded minute of interaction takes an hour to analyse. Moreover, many social cues are subtle, and not easily noticed by even the most attentive psychologists.",

                   "For decades many researchers have tended to view astrobiology as the underdog of space science. The field—which focuses on the investigation of life beyond Earth—has often been criticized as more philosophical than scientific, because it lacks in tangible samples to study. Now that is all changing. Whereas astronomers once knew of no planets outside our solar system, today they have thousands of examples.",

There are countries in which the education system seems primarily to reproduce existing social arrangements, conferring privilege where it already exists and denying it where it does not. Even in countries where the diagnosis might be less extreme, the capacity of schooling to build social cohesion is often diminished by the way in which schools separate individuals and groups.",

                   "With an abundance of low-priced labor relative to the United States, it is no surprise that China, India and other developing countries specialize in the production of labor-intensive products. For similar reasons, the United States will specialize in the production of goods that are human- and physical capital intensive because of the relative abundance of a highly-educated labor force and technically sophisticated equipment in the United States.",
                   "Russia has responded to the USA withdrawing from an arms treaty by announcing it has plans to build more missiles.

                   "We do now have good evidence that for some foods, like peanut and egg, being able to introduce the foods into the diet within the first year of life decreases the risk of infants at risk of food allergy from subsequently developing allergy to these specific foods. The original hygiene hypothesis has been revised to try and better explain the rise in allergies and other immune dysregulation type disorders.",

The value of “intangible” assets—everything from skilled workers to patents to know-how—has ballooned from 20 of the value of companies in the S P 500 to 70 today. The proportion of American workers doing jobs that call for complex skills has grown three times as fast as employment in general.

                   "In order for development to have a long-term positive effect, it must be sustainable. Sustainable development is about making sure that the earth's resources that we use to promote economic growth will be available to future generations. The current attention given to the threats posed by global climate change is an example of how human freedoms and human development can be eroded when economic growth and development is divorced from environmental concerns.",
                   "When you finish each section of your revision, give yourself a small reward. It doesn't have to be anything huge, just find something you like, and don't do it until you finish. It will give you an added incentive to get on with the study. For example, have a sticky bun on stand by, but you can't eat it until you've finished, or agree with friends that you'll have an evening out when you've all completed a set amount of study.",

Today, the government encourages them to delay their retirement.",
                   "One of the characteristics of ‘good’ information identified earlier was that it should be ‘balanced’. In an ideal world, ‘objective’ or ‘balanced’ information would present all the evidence for and against, and leave you to weigh this up and draw conclusions. In the real world, however, we .recognise that all information presents a position of interest, although this may not necessarily be intentional.",
